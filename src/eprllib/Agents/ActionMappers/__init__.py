ActionMappers
=========

This module defines the classes and functions used to perform actions on the
environment. These ActionMappers are responsible for transforming agent actions into
actuator commands within the environment.

The module includes the following classes:

- BaseActionMapper: The base class for creating action transformer functions.
- ActionMapperSpec: which is used to specify the configuration of ActionMapper functions.

These classes are used in the ``EnvironmentConfig`` class to specify the actions that can 
be performed on the environment.
