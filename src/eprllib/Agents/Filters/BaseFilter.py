Base Filter
============

This module contains the base class for defining filter functions used in agent specifications.
Filters are used to preprocess observations before they are fed to the agent. The `BaseFilter`
class provides the basic structure and methods that can be extended to create custom filters.

This class can not be used directly in eprllib, but as a base to create new filters. All the filters
must be based in this class.
