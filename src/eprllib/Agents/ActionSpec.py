Specification for the action space and actuators
===========================================================
This module defines the `ActionSpec` class, which is used to specify the configuration of action space and actuators for agents in reinforcement learning environments.

        Construction method.
        
        Args:
            actuators (List[Tuple[str, str, str]]): Actuators are the way that users modify the program at 
            runtime using custom logic and calculations. Not every variable inside EnergyPlus can be 
            actuated. This is intentional, because opening that door could allow the program to run at 
            unrealistic conditions, with flow imbalances or energy imbalances, and many other possible problems.
            Instead, a specific set of items are available to actuate, primarily control functions, 
            flow requests, and environmental boundary conditions. These actuators, when used in conjunction 
            with the runtime API and data exchange variables, allow a user to read data, make decisions and 
            perform calculations, then actuate control strategies for subsequent time steps.
            Actuator functions are similar, but not exactly the same, as for variables. An actuator
            handle/ID is still looked up, but it takes the actuator type, component name, and control
            type, since components may have more than one control type available for actuation. The
            actuator can then be “actuated” by calling a set-value function, which overrides an internal
            value, and informs EnergyPlus that this value is currently being externally controlled. To
            allow EnergyPlus to resume controlling that value, there is an actuator reset function as well.
            One agent can manage several actuators.

            ValueError: If the actuators are not defined as a list of tuples of 3 elements.
