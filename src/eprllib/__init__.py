========

``eprllib`` was born out of the need to bridge the gap between building modeling with 
**EnergyPlus** and Reinforcement Learning (**RL**). Traditionally, integrating these two 
disciplines has been complex and laborious. ``eprllib`` aims to simplify this process, 
offering an intuitive and flexible interface for developing intelligent agents that 
interact with building simulations.
