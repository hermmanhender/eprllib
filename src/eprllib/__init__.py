========

**eprllib** provides a set of methods to establish the computational loop of EnergyPlus within a Markov Decision Process (MDP), 
treating it as a multi-agent environment compatible with RLlib. The main goal is to offer a simple configuration of 
EnergyPlus as a standard environment for experimentation with Deep Reinforcement Learning.
